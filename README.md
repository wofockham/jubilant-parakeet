This is a subheading
--------------------

Paragraphs just work.

It's easy.

## Emphasis to your text

This is _italic_. This is __bold__.

What happens if you have ___three___?

Alternatively, this is *italic*. This is **bold**. And ***guess what this does***?

I use _this_ for italics and **this** for bold.

## Code

If you want to reference a variable or a function, you do it like this: `console.log`

You might want to try the `debugger` keyword.

```javascript
const hello = function () {
    console.log('Heyyy');
}
```

```css
body {
    background-color: blue;
}
```

```python
def hotdogs():
    print "Hotdogs
```
